{"name":"Apod-Slider","tagline":"","body":"### What is this?\r\nAPOD-Slider is a bare-bones image slider setup for NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD). It utilises lightSlider, and dynamically generates slides as the user approaches the end of the current slide array. It's downloadable as a full web page, but you are encouraged to implement it however you want - use it with lightSlider, or make edits to the script.js file and use it with any slider plugin you'd like (the main script is just over 100 lines and very easy to follow). \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis small bit of code was written by Isaac Hinman.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
